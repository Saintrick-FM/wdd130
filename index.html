            <p>
                I am a junior fullstack developper with 2 years of experience working now as a frontend developper in a
                digital agency. I currently live in Congo Brazzaville. At the same time I am working as a frontend developper in an agency named <a href="https://nanocreatives.com/">Nanocreatives</a>. 
               <br> I know that there are many advantages in learning web design like the fact of working
                as a freelancer, being an online teacher or an employee in a big company. I choosed BYU-Idaho because I do like the way they teach by getting students help each other. <br> I am still a bachelor who's looking for a good wife. I like the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I regularly attend to church seminaries even if I am not a member of the church.

        <h2>Downtown Brazzaville, beside Congo River</h2>
        <img src="./images/downtown-brazzaville-beside-the-congo-river.webp" alt="Brazzaville">
        <p>The Republic of Congo (Congo-Brazzaville), located in Central Africa, covers 342,000 km2. Its population of
            5.7 million people is largely young, with 47% being under age 18. More than half of the population lives in
            its two main cities â€” Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire. The country is one of the least densely populated in
            Africa, with 14.8 inhabitants per square kilometer.

            <br>Covered mainly by tropical forests, the Republic of Congo also has one of the largest areas of tropical
            peatlands, a fragile ecosystem that removes carbon from the atmosphere and stores it, thus helping to slow
            global warming.
